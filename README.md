# auth-password-store

This code does not (yet) work. Please **do not use**.

## Summary

Integrate Emacs' auth-source with password-store. The
[auth-source](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/auth.html)
library is a way for Emacs to answer the old burning question “What
are my user name and password?”.
[Password-store](http://www.passwordstore.org) (or just `pass`) is a
standard unix password manager following the Unix philosophy.

The auth-password-store project is a password-store backend for
auth-source.
